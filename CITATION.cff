abstract: >-
  A multi-model AI consensus pipeline for automated quantitative data
  extraction from scientific research papers for meta-analysis. Uses
  challenge-aware routing and dual-model extraction (Claude Sonnet 4,
  Kimi K2.5) with Gemini 3 Flash tiebreaker. Validated against three
  published meta-analysis datasets with formal TOST equivalence testing.
