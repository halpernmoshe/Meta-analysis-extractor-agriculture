  "name": "CO2 Effects on Plant Mineral Concentrations",
  "description": "This meta-analysis investigates how elevated atmospheric CO2 affects mineral element concentrations in plants. The key hypothesis is that elevated CO2 causes a 'dilution effect' - plants grow larger but mineral uptake doesn't keep pace, resulting in lower mineral concentrations. Based on Loladze et al. 2014 (eLife 3:e02245).",

  "intervention": "Elevated atmospheric CO2 (typically 550-700 ppm)",
  "control": "Ambient CO2 (typically 350-400 ppm)",

  "primary_outcomes": [
    "Mineral element concentrations: N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, S, B, Mo, Na, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se, Si, V, Al, Sr, Ba, Co, Cl"
  ],

  "expected_direction": "negative",
  "typical_effect_size": "-5% to -15% for most minerals",

  "important_moderators": [
    "Plant species/cultivar",
    "Tissue type (grain, leaf, root, shoot)",
    "Experimental system (FACE, OTC, greenhouse)",
    "Nitrogen fertilization level",
    "Study duration",
    "C3 vs C4 photosynthetic pathway"
  ],

  "extraction_priorities": [
    "1. CRITICAL: Extract EVERY ROW from tables - NO POOLING across cultivars, years, or treatments",
    "2. If table has 20 rows, you should have ~20 observations. Count them!",
    "3. Prioritize mineral concentration data over biomass data",
    "4. Get variance (SE/SD) and sample size (n) for meta-analysis weighting",
    "5. Record tissue type (grain vs leaf vs root) as it affects interpretation",
    "6. Record the specific CO2 levels (ppm) for both control and treatment"
  ],

  "tc_confusion_warnings": [
    "Watch for papers that report 'ambient' vs 'elevated' - ambient is control",
    "Some papers report percentage of ambient - 100% = control, >100% = elevated",
    "Water stress treatments (FWC levels) are NOT CO2 treatments",
    "If effect is strongly positive (+50%), verify T/C assignment",
    "AMF (mycorrhizal) treatments create factorial designs - extract both levels separately"
  ],
