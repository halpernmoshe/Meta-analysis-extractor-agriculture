  "name": "Biostimulant Effects on Crop Yield in Field Trials",
  "description": "This meta-analysis examines the effect of non-microbial plant biostimulants on crop yield in open-field trials. Biostimulant categories include seaweed extracts (SWE), protein hydrolysates (PHs), protein extracts (PE), humic/fulvic acids (HFA), chitosan (Chi), silicon (Si), and phosphite (Phi). Based on Li et al. 2022 (Frontiers in Plant Science 13:836702).",

  "intervention": "Plant biostimulant application (seaweed extract, humic acid, fulvic acid, protein hydrolysate, chitosan, silicon, phosphite)",

  "extraction_priorities": [
    "1. CRITICAL: Extract EVERY treatment combination separately",
    "2. Control = untreated/no biostimulant; treatment = with biostimulant",
    "3. If multiple rates or application timings, extract EACH vs control",
    "4. Get variance (SE/SD/LSD) and sample size (n)",
    "5. Record biostimulant type, rate, and application method",
    "6. Focus on FRESH YIELD as primary outcome"
  ],

  "tc_confusion_warnings": [
    "Control is the untreated/no-biostimulant treatment",
    "Some papers test multiple biostimulant products - extract each vs control",
    "Factorial designs (biostimulant x rate x timing): extract each combination",
    "LSD is common - extract as variance measure",
    "Watch for different units (g/plant vs kg/ha vs t/ha)"
