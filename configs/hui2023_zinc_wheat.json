  "name": "Zinc Biofortification in Wheat",
  "description": "This meta-analysis examines how Zn fertilizer application (soil, foliar, and soil+foliar) affects grain Zn concentration in wheat. The goal is agronomic biofortification to address Zn deficiency in human nutrition. Based on Hui et al. 2025 (Nature Communications 16:3913), 139 studies, 2,771 observations.",

  "intervention": "Zinc fertilizer application (ZnSO4, ZnO, Zn-EDTA, etc. via soil, foliar, or combined application)",
  "control": "No Zn fertilizer application (CK = control)",

  "primary_outcomes": [
    "Grain Zn concentration (mg/kg)"
  ],

  "expected_direction": "positive",
  "typical_effect_size": "+29% for soil application, +55% for foliar, +62% for soil+foliar",

  "important_moderators": [
    "Zn application method (soil, foliar, soil+foliar)",
    "Zn fertilizer type (ZnSO4, ZnO, Zn-EDTA, etc.)",
    "Zn application rate (kg Zn/ha)",
    "Spraying concentration (g Zn/L) for foliar",
    "Spraying timing (booting, heading, flowering, grain filling)",
    "Spraying frequency",
    "Country",
    "Soil available Zn (mg/kg)",

    "Organic matter (g/kg)",
    "N, P, K fertilization rates",

    "Initial grain yield"
  ],

  "extraction_priorities": [
    "1. CRITICAL: Extract EVERY treatment combination separately - no pooling across Zn rates, application methods, or timings",
    "2. Control = no Zn application (CK), treatment = with Zn application",
    "3. If factorial design (Zn rate x timing x form), extract each combination vs its control",
    "4. Get variance (SE/SD/LSD) and sample size (n) - many papers use LSD",
    "5. Record the Zn application rate, method, and fertilizer type for each observation",
    "6. Also extract grain yield and biomass when available alongside Zn concentration"
  ],

  "tc_confusion_warnings": [
    "Control is the zero-Zn treatment, not untreated plants",
    "Some papers use multiple Zn rates - extract EACH rate vs the zero-Zn control",
    "Foliar vs soil application are different treatments, not replicates",
    "LSD is very common - extract it as a variance measure",
    "Some papers report Zn biofortification index - this is derived, extract raw concentrations"
