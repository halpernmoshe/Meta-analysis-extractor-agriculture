  "name": "Silicon Effects on Wheat Yield and Quality",
  "description": "This meta-analysis examines how silicon (Si) application affects wheat grain yield, biomass, and mineral composition. Silicon is a beneficial element that improves stress tolerance. Based on Li et al. 2022 dataset.",

  "intervention": "Silicon fertilization (various forms: sodium silicate, potassium silicate, calcium silicate, diatomaceous earth)",
  "control": "No silicon application or zero Si treatment",

  "primary_outcomes": [
    "Grain yield (GWAD)",
    "Biomass/dry weight (CWAD)",
    "Plant height (PLHT)",
    "Mineral concentrations (Si, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn)"
  ],

  "expected_direction": "positive",
  "typical_effect_size": "+5% to +25% for grain yield; variable for minerals",

  "important_moderators": [
    "Wheat cultivar",
    "Silicon source (sodium silicate, potassium silicate, etc.)",
    "Silicon application rate (kg/ha Si)",
    "Application method (soil, foliar, seed treatment)",
    "Study type (field, greenhouse, growth chamber)",
    "Stress conditions (drought, salinity, heavy metal, none)",
    "Soil pH",
    "N fertilization level"
  ],

  "extraction_priorities": [
    "1. CRITICAL: Extract EVERY ROW from tables - NO POOLING across cultivars, rates, or stress levels",
    "2. If table has Si rate x stress level = 8 rows, extract all 8",
    "3. Control = zero Si or no Si treatment",
    "4. Get variance (SE/SD/LSD) and sample size (n)",
    "5. Record the Si rate/dose for each treatment",
    "6. Note stress conditions (drought, salinity, Cd, Cr) as moderators"
  ],

  "tc_confusion_warnings": [
    "Control is the zero-Si treatment, NOT untreated plants",
    "Some papers use multiple Si rates - extract EACH rate vs control separately",
    "Factorial designs with Si x stress: extract each combination as separate observation",
    "LSD is common in agronomy papers - extract it as a variance measure",
    "If effect is strongly negative (-50%), verify the correct control group"
  ],
